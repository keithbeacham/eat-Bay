<h1>About the app</h1>
<p>As a user, you can search for the location of your desired area, and the app will show the food establishments and their stock. A user can then navigate through the app. The user can also log in or create an account, which will allow them to reserve food items, delete reservations, and "like" a shop to add it to their favourites. This will enable push notifications for the user, notifying them when their favourite shop has posted a new food item.
</p>
<p>
As a shop owner, you are able to log in or create an account. A shop owner can add new food items, edit the food item quantity, and check for user reservations. Once the user enters the shop, they can match the user's reservation code based on what appears on the shop owner's side. The shop owner can then tap "sold" to confirm the food item has been given to the correct customer (user).

<h1>Setting up the app...</h1>

<p>To get started and have the application on your local terminal, you'll need to install the following:

<p>First, you need to install the dependencies:</p>

```sh
npm install
```

<p>Once all the dependencies have been installed, you'll need to run the following:</p>

```sh
npx expo start
```
<p>Once this is running on your terminal, a QR code will appear which you can scan with your phone, prompting you to download Expo Go (follow the instructions on your phone).</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you have an iPhone or Android emulator software, you'll need to open the emulator and on the terminal type either "a" to start up the Android emulator or "i" to start up the iPhone emulator.</p>
